Below is a sample `README.md` that provides a comprehensive explanation of how to use the `ruleEngine.js` module, how to integrate it into your application, and includes a sample `dslScript.js` for demonstration.

# Rule Engine DSL Interpreter

This module provides a way to define business rules using a DSL (Domain-Specific Language) that is close to natural English, and then execute these rules at runtime as various application events occur. Instead of just generating a static configuration, this engine **parses, compiles, and executes** these rules in real-time, making it easier for non-technical stakeholders or power users to define conditional logic and workflows.

## Key Features

- **Human-Readable DSL**: Write rules in a format like:
  ```  
  IF NEW order WHEN order.status = "paid" THEN
      send order to action.fulfillment
      send order to action.email
  ```

- **Event-Driven Execution**: Define rules for `NEW`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` events on entities (like `order` or `customer`).

- **Conditional Logic**: Use conditions such as `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `IS NULL`, `CONTAINS` combined with `AND`/`OR`.

- **Multiple Actions**: Perform actions like `update`, `send`, `notify`, `log`, `invoke`, and define your own through a context object.

- **Else Clause**: Support fallback actions with `ELSE`.

## Installation

```bash
npm install rule-engine-dsl
```

*Note: The above command assumes you’ve published the module to npm. If not, copy the `ruleEngine.js` file into your project.*

## Quick Start

1. **Define a DSL Script**: Write your rules in a `.js` or `.txt` file (e.g., `dslScript.js`).
2. **Create Your Action Handlers**: Integrate database connections, email services, or other resources in a `context` object.
3. **Load and Execute Rules**: Use the `RuleEngine` to parse your DSL and then call `processEvent` whenever an event occurs in your app.

### Example DSL Script

Create a file named `dslScript.js`:

```js
module.exports = `
IF NEW order WHEN order.status = "paid" THEN
    send order to action.fulfillment
    send order to action.email

IF UPDATE order WHEN order.status = "paid" AND order.total > 500 THEN
    update order.status = "premium"
    send order to action.notify.vip_team
ELSE
    send order to action.email.standard_confirmation
`;
```

**What this DSL does**:
- When a new `order` is created and its `status = "paid"`, it sends the order to `fulfillment` and `email` actions.
- When an `order` is updated and `status = "paid" AND total > 500`, it updates its status to `"premium"` and notifies the VIP team.
- Otherwise, if the `status = "paid"` but `total <= 500`, it sends a `standard_confirmation` email.

### Defining Action Handlers

You must provide the `context.actions` object that knows how to perform the actions defined in the DSL. For example:

```js
const context = {
  // You might store database clients, email services, or API clients here
  dbClient: myDatabaseClient,
  emailService: myEmailClient,
  notificationService: myNotificationService,
  
  actions: {
    update: async (ctx, entity, field, value) => {
      // Perform a database update
      await ctx.dbClient.updateEntityField(entity, field, value);
    },
    send: async (ctx, entity, destination) => {
      if (destination === 'action.email') {
        await ctx.emailService.send({
          to: 'customer@example.com',
          subject: 'Your Order is Paid',
          body: `Order ${entity} is now ready for fulfillment.`
        });
      } else if (destination === 'action.fulfillment') {
        await ctx.notificationService.requestFulfillment(entity);
      } else if (destination === 'action.email.standard_confirmation') {
        await ctx.emailService.send({
          to: 'customer@example.com',
          subject: 'Your Order Confirmation',
          body: `Order ${entity} has been updated and is confirmed.`
        });
      } else if (destination === 'action.notify.vip_team') {
        await ctx.notificationService.notifyTeam('vip_team', `Premium order: ${entity}`);
      }
    },
    notify: async (ctx, target) => {
      await ctx.notificationService.notifyTeam(target, 'An event occurred');
    },
    log: (ctx, message) => {
      console.log(`Log: ${message}`);
    },
    invoke: (ctx, functionName, args) => {
      // If you have a functions map
      if (ctx.functions && typeof ctx.functions[functionName] === 'function') {
        return ctx.functions[functionName](...args);
      } else {
        console.warn(`No function named ${functionName}`);
      }
    },
    unknown: (ctx, line) => {
      console.warn(`Unknown action: ${line}`);
    }
  }
};
```

This is just an example. In a real application, you’ll implement these methods to interact with your database, send emails, call APIs, etc.

### Using the Rule Engine

```js
const { RuleEngine } = require('./ruleEngine'); // Adjust path if necessary
const dslScript = require('./dslScript'); // The DSL rules we wrote above
const context = require('./context'); // The context and actions defined above

// Create the rule engine from the DSL
const engine = RuleEngine.fromDSL(dslScript);

// Now simulate events:
(async () => {
  // New order event
  await engine.processEvent('NEW', 'order', {status: 'paid'}, context);
  // This should trigger sending to fulfillment and email.

  // Update order event: high value premium
  await engine.processEvent('UPDATE', 'order', {status: 'paid', total: 600}, context);
  // This should update status to premium and notify VIP team.

  // Update order event: standard value
  await engine.processEvent('UPDATE', 'order', {status: 'paid', total: 100}, context);
  // This should send standard confirmation email.
})();
```

### Understanding the Workflow

1. **Loading DSL**: `RuleEngine.fromDSL(dslScript)` parses and compiles the rules into `Rule` objects.
2. **Processing Events**: Each time `processEvent(eventType, entity, data, context)` is called:
   - The engine checks every rule to see if `eventType` and `entity` match.
   - If conditions (`WHEN` clause) are satisfied, the `THEN` actions run.
   - If conditions are not met but there’s an `ELSE` clause, those actions run.
3. **Executing Actions**: Actions call the functions defined in `context.actions`. You are free to integrate these functions with your actual business logic.

### Error Handling & Logging

- If the DSL is malformed, the parser throws an error with a descriptive message.
- Unknown conditions or actions log warnings but do not crash the application.
- For real-world scenarios, integrate with a logging framework (like Winston or Pino) and possibly add more robust error handling.

### Extending the DSL

- **Add New Condition Operators**: Modify the `_evaluateCondition` method in `Rule` to support new comparison operators.
- **Add New Actions**: Add a new function in `context.actions` to handle a custom verb (like `queue`, `archive`, `sync_with_crm`).
- **Add Utility Functions**: Insert more `invoke` functions in `context.functions` for custom logic (e.g., `calculateDiscount`, `validateAddress`).

### Testing and Validation

- **Unit Testing**: Write tests to ensure that given certain inputs (events, data), the rules produce the correct actions.
- **Integration Testing**: Validate that the actions actually update databases or send emails as intended when integrated with your real services.

## Conclusion

The `ruleEngine.js` and `DSLParser` approach allow you to write flexible, business-friendly rules and apply them to your data in real-time. By separating the DSL interpretation from the actual actions, you maintain a clean architecture that’s easy to update and maintain as your business logic evolves.

---

**In summary**:
- Write your rules in a human-readable DSL.
- Provide context with `actions` that know how to perform the tasks.
- Call `processEvent()` whenever you need to execute those rules in response to application events.
