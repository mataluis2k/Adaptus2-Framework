### Release Notes â€“ Dynamic Route Handler Enhancements

#### New Features & Enhancements

- **Automatic WHERE Clause Injection:**  
  - Introduced a helper function to inspect the provided SQL query and automatically insert a dummy `WHERE 1=1` clause if none exists.  
  - This insertion is performed before key clauses such as `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, or `LIMIT` to ensure that additional filters can be appended safely.

- **Improved UUID Mapping for Primary Keys:**  
  - Enhanced dynamic endpoints to support UUID masking by converting the primary key (as defined in the endpoint configuration) into a UUID using `uuidv7`.
  - **Reverse Mapping Implementation:**  
    - Added reverse mapping in Redis using keys in the format `uuidMapping:original:<originalId>`.  
    - Before generating a new UUID for a record, the system now checks if an existing UUID is already associated with the original ID. If found, it reuses the existing UUID instead of generating a new one.
  - This change minimizes duplicate UUID entries in Redis and optimizes memory usage on heavily used servers.

- **Robust Redis Initialization:**  
  - Updated the Redis initialization to load the connection string from `process.env.REDIS_URL` (with a fallback to `redis://localhost:6379`), ensuring that environment variables loaded via the `.env` file are available across all modules.

- **Enhanced Single-Record Query Handling:**  
  - When a record is requested using a UUID filter (e.g., `/api/pending-messages?id=<uuid>`), the system performs a lookup in Redis to convert the UUID back to the original primary key, ensuring correct and consistent data retrieval.

- **General Improvements:**  
  - Improved error handling and logging across the dynamic route handler.
  - Maintained consistency in response formatting and business logic processing.

These enhancements collectively improve the reliability, scalability, and maintainability of dynamic endpoints by ensuring proper SQL query structure, efficient UUID mapping, and optimal use of caching with Redis.
