# **FlexAPI Server**: The Highly Scalable and Configurable API Framework for Node.js  
*"Build robust, dynamic, and high-performance APIs with effortless OpenGraph metadata configuration."*

---

## **2. Overview**
   - Brief introduction:
     - What it is: A Node.js framework for scalable, configurable API services with advanced features like dynamic OpenGraph metadata handling.
     - Why it matters: Offers seamless configuration via `apiConfig.json` and enables developers to set up highly flexible and efficient APIs without reinventing the wheel.

## **5. Getting Started**
   ### **Installation**
   ```bash
   npm install flexapi-server
   ```

   ### **Basic Usage**
   - Example setup:
     ```javascript
     const FlexAPIServer = require('flexapi-server');

     const app = new FlexAPIServer({
       port: 3000,
       configPath: './config/apiConfig.json',
     });

     app.start(() => {
       console.log('FlexAPI Server is running on port 3000');
     });
     ```

---

## **6. Configuration**
   ### **API Configuration**
   - Define your API endpoints in `apiConfig.json`:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "route": "/api/example",
         "method": "GET",
         "type": "proxy",
         "targetUrl": "https://example.com",
         "queryMapping": {
           "localParam": "externalParam"
         },
         "responseMapping": {
           "externalField": "localField"
         },
         "cache": {
           "enabled": true,
           "ttl": 3600
         }
       }
     ]
     ```
   ### **OpenGraph Metadata**
   - Example configuration for dynamic OpenGraph metadata:
     ```json
     {
       "route": "/api/metadata",
       "method": "GET",
       "type": "metadata",
       "title": "Dynamic Title",
       "description": "Automatically configured OpenGraph description",
       "url": "https://yourdomain.com"
     }
     ```

---

## **7. Advanced Features**
   - **Dynamic Table Initialization**: Automatically create database tables using `apiConfig.json`.
   - **Proxy Enrichment**: Combine external API responses with internal data.
   - **GraphQL API**: Automatically generate and expose GraphQL endpoints.
